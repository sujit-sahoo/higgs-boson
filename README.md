# higgs-boson

Objective: A Classification problem which distinguishes between

a signal process which produces Higgs bosons and a background process which does not.

column1-class; Target (which you need to predict)

The first 21 features (columns 2-22) are kinematic properties measured by the particle detectors in the accelerator.

The (23-29)  features are functions of the first 21 features; these are high-level features derived by physicists to help discriminate between the two classes.
